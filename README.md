This script is an extension to make inputting the new speedlimits easy, by adding graphic speedsigns right above the input fields.

For the current list of supported countries, visit the following link to the GreasyFork script: https://greasyfork.org/nl/scripts/13774-wme-speedhelper

If you want your country added to the list, contact your local GC and have him/her add the following info:
country name & Waze abbreviation (use this bookmarklet)
The list of possible speeds as displayed on the roadsigns
Kph or mph?
an image of how a roadsign looks like. Only needed if it isn't a red circle with a white background and black text :)
If anyone has an idea to make this script better, let me know and will take a look...
